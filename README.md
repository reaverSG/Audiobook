Description:
This project aims to create an audiobook using Python, leveraging text-to-speech functionality. The current implementation is a work-in-progress and may encounter issues. The code attempts to convert text files into spoken audio using Python libraries, but users may encounter bugs related to text processing, audio playback, or library compatibility. Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve functionality and resolve issues.

Features:

Text-to-speech conversion for plain text files.
Basic navigation and playback controls.
Integration with Python's pyttsx3 or gTTS for speech synthesis.
Current Issues:

Text segmentation issues affecting speech clarity.
Audio playback interruptions and errors.
Compatibility issues with specific operating systems or Python versions.
